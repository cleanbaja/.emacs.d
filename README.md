## Installation

Run the following command in your terminal

```bash
$ cd <EMACS-DIR>
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cleanbaja/.emacs.d
```

**NOTE: A working [emacs](gnu.org/software/emacs) installation is required!**

`<EMACS-DIR>` is defined as follows...

  - Windows: `C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Roaming`
  - Unix-based OSes: `/home/{Username}/`

After doing the above 2 steps, install the Jetbrains Mono font (click the open-source badge for link). Finally, launch emacs in graphical mode, which is the default mode on most systems, and type `<ALT>-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` and follow the given instructions to install the rest of the fonts on your system.

With that done, you're good to go :-)
